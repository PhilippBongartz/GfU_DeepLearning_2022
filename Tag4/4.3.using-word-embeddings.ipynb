    "resulting embedding space would have no structure: for instance, the words \"accurate\" and \"exact\" may end up with completely different \n",

    "synonyms to be embedded into similar word vectors, and in general we would expect the geometric distance (e.g. L2 distance) between any two \n",
    "word vectors to relate to the semantic distance of the associated words (words meaning very different things would be embedded to points \n",
    "far away from each other, while related words would be closer). Even beyond mere distance, we may want specific __directions__ in the \n",
    "embedding space to be meaningful. \n",

    "Word embedding spaces typically feature thousands of such interpretable and potentially useful vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there some \"ideal\" word embedding space that would perfectly map human language and could be used for any natural language processing \n",
