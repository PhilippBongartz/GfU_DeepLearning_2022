    "Note that by training a bigger model, longer, on more data, you can achieve generated samples that will look much more coherent and \n",

    "sampling data from a statistical model of which characters come after which characters. Language is a communication channel, and there is \n",
    "a distinction between what communications are about, and the statistical structure of the messages in which communications are encoded. To \n",
    "evidence this distinction, here is a thought experiment: what if human language did a better job at compressing communications, much like \n",
    "our computers do with most of our digital communications? Then language would be no less meaningful, yet it would lack any intrinsic \n",

    "* We can generate discrete sequence data by training a model to predict the next tokens(s) given previous tokens.\n",
    "* In the case of text, such a model is called a \"language model\" and could be based on either words or characters.\n",
    "* Sampling the next token requires balance between adhering to what the model judges likely, and introducing randomness.\n",
    "* One way to handle this is the notion of _softmax temperature_. Always experiment with different temperatures to find the \"right\" one."
